# DCB-Dynamic-Codon-Bias
A tool for dynamically calculating the codon usage bias in bacterial genomes.


Currently:

We have a fully assembled NCBI pipeline. We need to integrate this into the flask web applicatiojn, clean code up, comment, bug find/fix, and lastly beautify the interface. 


2) Bugfix and make code softer.
3) Make the file output to HTML
4) Input validation

Then we can focus on improving the design of our code by refactoring, improving user interface, and then more stress testing.


Note:

Program runs in about 8.14 seconds on an averaged sized bacterial genome.
